    name: Walking on walls
    description: Gravity is an intractable thing and usually allows you to walk only
      on horizontal surfaces, and when you try to climb a steep wall, it immediately
      pulls you down. However, there are characters who can climb walls or even ceilings.
      Some use technical devices for this - various hooks or, say, suction cups,
      if the wall allows you to cling to it or stick to it.

    name: Flight
    description: Flight is the movement of a body in a gaseous medium or vacuum,
      occurring both under the influence of propulsion (for example, jet thrust)
      and by inertia, under the influence of an impulse applied to the body (for
      example, the flight of an arrow, another throwing or artillery shell). Controlling
      flight altitude in a gravitational field at speeds below orbital speed requires,
      in addition to imparting forward motion, the use of support means - static
      or dynamic;

    name: Leave in English
    description: "\u201CLeaving in English\u201D is what they say when someone leaves
      without saying goodbye. You might think that the expression makes fun of the
      impolite behavior of the British. However, British subjects, like no other,
      strive to follow the rules of etiquette. They say goodbye to others for a long
      time and courteously before leaving, and consider other behavior a sign of
      bad taste and call it a similar expression - \u201Cleave in French.\u201D"

    name: Immortality
    description: "Unsterblichkeit ist Leben in physischer oder spiritueller Form,
      das nicht auf unbestimmte Zeit (oder f\xFCr einen bestimmten Zeitraum) endet.
      Bei der Unsterblichkeit in physischer Form wird zwischen bedingter biologischer
      Unsterblichkeit (dem Fehlen des individuellen Todes als Endstadium der Ontogenese
      \u2013 siehe Fortpflanzung durch Teilung) unterschieden. Einzeller und die
      hypothetische biologische Unsterblichkeit komplexer vielzelliger Lebewesen,
      darunter und vor allem des Menschen."
